In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are three distinct objects that represent different aspects of the browser environment. Here's a brief explanation of the differences between them:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

window Object:

The window object represents the browser window or the global JavaScript context for the current web page.

It provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser window, including features like opening and closing windows, setting timeouts, and more.

Global variables and functions are attached to the window object, so you can access them globally in your JavaScript code.




window.alert("Hello, world!"); 
// ^ Displays an alert dialog in the browser window


------------------------------------------------------------------------------



screen Object:

The screen object represents the user's screen or display.
It provides information about the user's screen size, resolution, and other display-related properties.

You can use the screen object to create responsive designs and adjust content based on the user's screen.



console.log("Screen width: " + screen.width); 
// ^ Outputs the screen width

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


document Object:

The document object represents the web page itself or the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page.

It provides access to the structure and content of the web page, allowing you to manipulate HTML elements, change styles, and respond to user interactions.
The document object is commonly used to interact with and modify the content of a web page using JavaScript.



var heading = document.getElementById("myHeading"); 
// ^ Retrieves an HTML element with the ID "myHeading"
heading.innerHTML = "New Heading"; 
// ^ Changes the text content of the heading element


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In summary, 

> window is the global context representing the browser window, 
> screen represents display-related information, 
> document represents the web page's structure and content. 

These objects serve different purposes and provide access to various aspects of the web browsing environment.
